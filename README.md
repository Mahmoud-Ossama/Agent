‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations
Tool Availability
The agent uses penetration testing tools like:

nmap, sqlmap, nikto, dirb, gobuster, etc.
On Windows:

Some tools may need to be installed separately
Consider using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for better tool compatibility
Or use Kali Linux in a VM
On Linux (especially Kali Linux):

Most penetration testing tools come pre-installed
Better compatibility and performance for security tools
üéØ Recommended Approaches
Option 1: Windows + WSL2 (Recommended)
Install WSL2 with Ubuntu/Kali Linux
Install Python and the required tools in WSL
Run the agent from WSL environment
Option 2: Windows Native
Install required tools individually for Windows
Some tools have Windows versions (nmap, curl, etc.)
May have limited functionality compared to Linux versions
Option 3: Virtual Machine
Run Kali Linux or Ubuntu in VirtualBox/VMware
Full compatibility with all penetration testing tools
Isolated environment for security testing
Option 4: Docker Container
Create a containerized environment with all tools
Cross-platform compatibility
Easy deployment and sharing
üîß Your Current Setup
Your code already handles cross-platform execution:

Windows: run_dynamic.bat
Linux/macOS: run_dynamic.sh
Direct Python: Works on any OS with Python installed
üí° Recommendation
For the best experience, I'd recommend:

WSL2 on Windows - gives you Linux compatibility while staying on Windows
Kali Linux VM - if you want the full penetration testing environment
Windows native - for basic testing, but with limited tool availability
