1. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & STAGE COORDINATION:
   - Distribute CPU-intensive tasks across terminals intelligently
   - Avoid conflicting network scans and rate-limited operations
   - Stagger timing for bandwidth-intensive operations
   - Save stage results immediately after completion

2. DEPENDENCY TRACKING & DATA FLOW:
   - Monitor completion status of prerequisite commands in real-time
   - Queue dependent commands until prerequisites complete
   - Share critical findings between terminals using shared memory
   - Cross-reference stage results for comprehensive analysis

3. INTELLIGENT ADAPTATION & RESULT CORRELATION:
   - Adjust terminal assignments based on discovered services
   - Prioritize high-value targets and critical vulnerabilities
   - Scale parallel operations based on target responsiveness
   - Correlate findings across stages for attack path analysis

4. STAGE-BASED RESULT PERSISTENCE:
   - Save reconnaissance_results.json after Phase 1 completion
   - Save enumeration_results.json after Phase 2 completion
   - Save vulnerability_analysis_results.json after Phase 3 completion
   - Save exploitation_results.json after Phase 4 completion
   - Generate consolidated parallel_pentest_report.md at the end
